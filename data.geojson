The query is the following: (where 'GEOM' is the geometry field, id the field to include in json properties, shapefile_feature the table name, and 489445 is the id of the feature wanted)

SELECT row_to_json(f) As feature \
     FROM (SELECT 'Feature' As type \
     , ST_AsGeoJSON('GEOM')::json As geometry \
     , row_to_json((SELECT l FROM (SELECT id AS feat_id) As l)) As properties \
     FROM shapefile_feature As l WHERE l.id = 489445) As f;
output:

{
   "geometry":{
      "type":"MultiPolygon",
      "coordinates":[
         [
            [
               [
                  -309443.24253826,
                  388111.579584133
               ],
               [
                  -134666.391073443,
                  239616.414560895
               ],
               [
                  -308616.222736376,
                  238788.813082666
               ],
               [
                  -309443.24253826,
                  388111.579584133
               ]
            ]
         ]
      ]
   },
   "type":"Feature",
   "properties":{
      "feat_id":489445

}
